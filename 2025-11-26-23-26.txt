Analysis of Your Work
1. ✅ Phase 0 - PERFECT!
What you did correctly:

✅ Uploaded fastapi-service/ directory structure
✅ Uploaded dependencies to /home/rb_admin2/.rb-ocr-dependencies/
✅ All wheels are x86_64 Linux (Pillow, rapidfuzz, pydantic_core, etc.)
Phase 0 is 100% COMPLETE!

2. ✅ Phase 1.1 - PERFECT!
What you did correctly:

bash
cp -r ../main-dev/rb-ocr/pipeline/ ./pipeline/
All expected files are there:

✅ 
orchestrator.py
✅ clients/ (llm_client, tesseract_async_client)
✅ 
core/
 (config, errors, validity)
✅ processors/ (validator, fio_matching, agent_*)
✅ prompts/ (dtc, extractor)
✅ utils/ (artifacts, io_utils, timing)
Phase 1.1 is 100% COMPLETE!

3. ⚠️ Phase 1.2 - Import Error is EXPECTED
The error you got:

python
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'httpx'
This is NORMAL and EXPECTED!

Why?

Dependencies are in /home/rb_admin2/.rb-ocr-dependencies/ ✅
But they're not installed in Python yet ❌
Phase 2 is where we install them!
Two issues in your test command:

cd apps/fastapi-service/ - Wrong! You're already in /home/rb_admin2/apps/fastapi-service/
Import failed - Expected, because Python packages not installed yet
✅ Summary: You're On Track!
Phase	Status	Notes
Phase 0	✅ COMPLETE	Dependencies uploaded, directory created
Phase 1.1	✅ COMPLETE	Pipeline copied successfully
Phase 1.2	⏸️ SKIP FOR NOW	Will pass after Phase 2
Next Step: Phase 2 (Install Dependencies Offline)
Run this on the server:

bash
cd /home/rb_admin2/apps/fastapi-service/

# Create Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install from offline wheels
pip install --no-index --find-links /home/rb_admin2/.rb-ocr-dependencies/ -r /home/rb_admin2/.rb-ocr-dependencies/requirements.txt
After Phase 2, the import test will pass!
